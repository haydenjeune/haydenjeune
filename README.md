### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Hayden Jeune, a Junior Software Engineer currently building data focussed applications at Xero. I love to understand how things work under the hood, broadly interested in all things tech, and in particular, how to build scalable and reliable software systems. I also love dogs and planes.
